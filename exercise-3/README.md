# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if
you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal
command you've learned thus far in the class (or elsewhere ;-).  In particular, you
should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command

An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)

A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

## COMMAND GIT CLONE URL

```git clone https://github.com/ClemMooc/ch03-markdown.git```

- it can access github
  - you need to get a github fork
  - you press clone and you get a URL to paste into command
- once command runs, you have a directory on wherever your current destination is on command line
